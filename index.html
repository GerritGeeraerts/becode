        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="./self.png" alt="self.me" width="150">
        <p>From a young age I was lucky to have access to computers, I found it a very magical device that showed stuff on the screen like paint, this was in the days of windows 3.11, yes in the full 16 colors. So later I made the obvious choice to study informatics and rolled into first job as system administrator, managing computer accounts and servers. I noticed that the crucial component that gave me the most excitement was being able to leverage the computers power. This providing an easier and more efficient work environment for an organisation. But in system administration this feeling feels honed out. I don't see any more challenges at setting up systems so users can have an easier and more efficient digital life. I see a lot more potential and bigger leverage in modern applications, data analysis and complex AI models. The recent development and use cases of AI trigger give me the same magic feeling I had as a young kid. So i started to improve my programming skill in my free time to prepare me for a career shift towards AI. The choice to follow an AI data scientist course is a no brainier. I look forward in learning all about how AI is used in organisations and landing my first AI job. Below i added some of my many home projects that show a bit of my journey in trying to prepare for a career switch towards AI.</p>

                <h3>Fear and Greed Crypto Currency Trading Bot</h3>
                <img src="./DALL-E_bitcoin.png" alt="dollar cost averaging">
                <p>The idea for this home project was to find a superior strategy to dollar cost averaging. An example of dollar cost averaging is purchasing $10 worth of bitcoin every week. To optimize this, I aimed to buy only when there was a significant amount of fear in the market.. This is because prices are lower during such times, and it's challenging to buy when the market appears fearful. I discovered a signal named <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" target="_blank">Fear and Greed</a> that indicates when there is fear and greed in the market.". But in this signal most of the values weren't evenly distributed around the center. The signal indicates long periods where fear or greed is dominant, this would mean that it would have long periods where it would buy every week, and long periods where it would not buy at al. This somewhat contradicts the dollar cost averaging strategy as it aims to average out the risk buy buying regularly. So I needed a better centerline that removes the "seasonal" component of the signal. So I regularly get a singal to buy when there is relatively is a lot of fear. To recalibrate the signal I used Fast Fourier Transformation which focused on the 4 year cycle of bitcoin, this to have a better centerline. I had lots of fun in this project and pushed me to my edge and it was very technical and chalenging for me. I've always been curious if AI could help find a better center line. I didn't explore this earlier because the project was already quite technical and pushed me to use a lot of new things. Overall, I enjoyed the project, and since I didn't use AI, I feel there's more to discover in the future ðŸ˜‰</p>

                <p>To provide me with equal tools to battle the neverending waves of spam in my inbox. I created a tool that reads my gmails, it to find unsubscribe links. I did this by creating some complex regex queries. Than later sends you an overview with all the unsubscribe links to finaly escape all the spam? This is also a project where I find that AI could provide much better results.</p>

                <h3>Custom keyboard</h3>
                <img src="./corne_lp.jpg" alt="Corne LP">
                <p>For most of my career I have been working with computers alot. I have learned and discovered so many thing about computers but typing blind was not one of them. I was actualy surprised by this realization and being late to the party had the advantage of being able to have a propper look at the keybord world. During my keyboard journey i discovered some cool things. Alot of the design came from typewriters. For example when you hit 2 letter simultamious that are next to each other the arm of the typewrite would collide. So if you are typing fast enough the arms of the typewriter would collide if the letters where next to each others. Therefore the layout of the keyboard was made so most of the time the letters where not next to each other. Thus meaning u have to travel alot of distance with your fingers. With modern keyboards this doesnt make any sence, we want are finger to move as litle as possible. So i choose the colemac layout which tacles this issue. Another thing I discovered is that if you look at the keys in 1 row they are not in the same line in the extend of our fingers, but they are slightly tilted. Also keyboards have a alot of keys on 1 row and this forces us to push our hands togheter on a keyboard. When typing alot this can put stress on our wrists. Keeping this knowledge in mind i went in search for my perfect keyboard. I came across an awsome github repository where tons of people where designing keyboard, from the layout to the software that is ran on keyboard. The picture shows the keyboard that made the most sence for me. I ordered all the part, soldered everything togheter and programmed the software on the controller and i wat good to go. I had alot of fun doing this project and the love for open source commuity increased. Its a place where everyone colaborates, helps, shares, teaches and learns withouth trying to get into your backpockets. A wunderfull place where I feel home and can geek out!</p>
